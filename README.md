###### Dependancy Installation Instructions:
- Python 3

    - Windows users make sure you add python to your environment path variables

  - Mac: (I highly reccomend you take a look at installing Homebrew if you havent already. This will simplify the installation of MongoDB as well as many other libraries you may encounter... Otherwise you can install manually, this guide shows both ways.) https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/
  - Windows: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/
